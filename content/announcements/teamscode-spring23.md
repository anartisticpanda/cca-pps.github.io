Last saturday, 4 teams represented our club at [the 2023 spring TeamsCode contest](https://www.teamscode.org/contests/spring-2023/).

Club members worked together in their teams of 4 during the 3-hour contest to solve 12 challenging algorithmic tasks.

Special congratulations to CCA Team 1, who placed 5th among 212 total teams!
